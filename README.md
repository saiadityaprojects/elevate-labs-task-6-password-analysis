Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship - Task 6
This repository contains the report and supporting materials for my Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship, Task 6: "Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength."

Objective
The main goal of this task was to understand the principles of a strong password and to practically evaluate the strength of various passwords using an online strength checker. This exercise reinforced best practices for password security.

screenshots/: A folder containing all screenshots of the password strength checker results, which serve as visual evidence for the report's findings.

Key Learnings
Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of the following concepts:

Password Strength and Length: The critical role of password length in enhancing security against brute-force attacks.

Complexity: The importance of using a combination of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) to resist dictionary attacks.

Common Attacks: I learned about common password attacks, such as brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.

Best Practices: I reinforced the importance of using unique passphrases and learned about other security measures like multi-factor authentication.
